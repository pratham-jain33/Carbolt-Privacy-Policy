                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                    Carbolt ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard your information when you use our Chrome browser extension.

                <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
                
                <h3>1. Browsing Activity Data</h3>
                <p>
                    Carbolt monitors network traffic to measure the size of data transferred during your browsing sessions. This data is used solely to calculate the estimated energy consumption and carbon emissions associated with your internet usage.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>What we access:</strong> URLs of websites visited, data transfer sizes (bytes), and session duration.</li>
                    <li><strong>How it's used:</strong> To compute real-time carbon footprint metrics.</li>
                    <li><strong>Where it's stored:</strong> All browsing data is processed and stored <strong>locally on your device</strong> using Chrome's Storage API.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>2. Location Data</h3>
                <p>
                    To provide context-aware features such as local Air Quality Index (AQI) and regional grid carbon intensity, we may use your approximate location.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>What we access:</strong> IP-based geolocation or browser-provided coordinates (with your permission).</li>
                    <li><strong>How it's used:</strong> To fetch local environmental data from third-party APIs.</li>
                    <li><strong>Third-party services:</strong> Location data may be sent to external APIs (e.g., air quality services) to retrieve environmental metrics.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>3. User Preferences</h3>
                <p>
                    We store your preferences (such as theme settings and session history) locally on your device to enhance your experience.
                </p>

                <h2>Data Storage & Security</h2>
                <p>
                    All carbon footprint calculations and browsing metrics are processed and stored <strong>locally on your device</strong> using Chrome's built-in Storage API. We do not maintain external servers or databases that store your personal browsing data.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Location data sent to third-party environmental APIs is used solely for fetching real-time AQI and grid intensity data and is not stored by us.
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Air Quality Index (AQI) providers</li>

                <p>
                    These services have their own privacy policies, and we encourage you to review them. We only send the minimum data necessary (e.g., approximate location) to retrieve environmental metrics.
